description:
 This check uses the output of the summary line of {exiqsumm} as sent 
 by the linux agent of Check_MK. The command lists length, size and age
 of the mail queue of exim.
 The check analyzes the summary line.

 This check creates one service per host which represents the state
 of the servers mailqueue.

 The check will result in WARNING/CRITICAL states when the number of items, 
 the size or the age of the oldest mail in the queue reach the defined
 thresholds.

examples:
 # At 11 mails in the queue the check will result in a WARNING state
 # With 21 mails a CRITICAL state will be raised
 exim_mailq_default_levels = {
    'length':           (10, 20),
    'size':             (1048576, 2097152),
    'age':              (3600, 7200),
 }

perfdata:
 Three variables: the number of messages in {length}, the {size} of the
 messages in the queue in bytes and the {age} of the oldes mail in the queue.

inventory:
 On each system which provides the {exim} command one service is being created.

[parameters]

 tuples of two integers which represent the WARNING and the CRITICAL
 threshold threshold for each supported value.

[configuration]
exim_mailq_default_levels (dict from string to (int, int)): default levels
 used for all inventorized checks.
